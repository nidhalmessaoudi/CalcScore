</br>
</br>
=> The project contains only one package which is org.nidhal; </br>
=> The main method is on the Main Class. So, in <code>~/src/</code> dir, just run:
<ul>
  <li><code>javac org/nidhal/*.java</code> to compile the app. Then: </li>
  <li><code>java org.nidhal.Main</code> to run it;</li>
</ul>

That's it :)
